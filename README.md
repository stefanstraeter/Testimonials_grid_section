## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 – semantic and accessible structure
- CSS3 – modern layout techniques (CSS Grid, Flexbox, Custom Properties)
- Responsive Design – mobile-first approach using media queries
- CSS Reset Stylesheet – ensures consistent styling across browsers

### Key Features & Approaches

#### Mobile-First Workflow

- Base styles prioritize small screen usability.
- Layout begins as a single-column stack with consistent vertical rhythm.
- Media queries enhance layout only when screen real estate allows.

#### Responsive CSS Grid

- Grid layout defined using grid-template-areas for clear structure and maintainability.
- Custom card areas ("daniel daniel", "patrick kira", etc.) enable layout variations without breaking flow.
- clamp() and repeat() functions improve adaptability across breakpoints.

#### Semantic & Scalable Code

- Use of semantic <section>, <header>, <h1>, and <span> tags enhances accessibility.
- CSS variables (--Grey-100, --Purple-500, etc.) centralize theme management.
- Utility classes like .text-light and .text-dark improve readability and reduce repetition.
